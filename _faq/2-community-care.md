## Joining as a Community Care Ambassador / Healthcare Assistant

### Who can join?
While caregiving experience is relevant, we welcome individuals with or without healthcare background to join us. Please indicate your interest via the forms on the respective links, and ensure that you can commit to the full training duration. Do note that you must be aged 18 years old and above to be considered for training and roles.

### How and where will I serve, if I am activated?
With the support of the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC), you will be matched to a community care organisation providing care for seniors in settings such as nursing homes or senior care centres. Most of these organisations offer full-time or part-time work opportunities, or volunteer roles. As part of your training, you will receive on-the-job training in some of these organisations - you may consider staying on to serve with them, or secure a match with another organisation recommended by AIC. As your training is fully funded, enlistees are expected to serve for at least 3 months with a community care organisation post-training.

### Will I require additional insurance or indemnity to support COVID-19 efforts?
Your safety is our priority. You will be working alongside care teams in the community care organisations, who will put in place precautionary measures and training to ensure workplace safety and health. On your part, please note to only serve if you are well, i.e. have no flu-like symptoms such as fever and cough, and do not have long-term health conditions that put you at increased risk of COVID-19 or other illnesses.

To the extent not covered by any existing insurance, indemnity, or compensation schemes, the Government of the Republic of Singapore will indemnify anything done or omitted to be done in good faith and with reasonable care by all medical practitioners and healthcare workers, in the discharge of their functions and duties in efforts to prevent and reduce the spread of COVID-19.

### I've signed up via one of the forms. What's next?
Thank you for your interest in joining the SG Healthcare Corps! If you have signed up, you will be invited to join our outreach channels to receive the latest updates. If there is a good match, we will be in touch with you via email or phone call to confirm your enlistment and training placement. Stay tuned, share this opportunity to #standby4SG, and keep well.
