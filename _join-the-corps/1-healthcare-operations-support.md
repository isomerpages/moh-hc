Healthcare Operations Support Staff work alongside our healthcare professionals in COVID-19 related operations at sites such as community isolation facilities, dormitory operations, hospitals, and community care settings. Individuals may be deployed to support healthcare professionals in one of these tasks:

- Swabs - support clinical tests and diagnosis through the nasopharyngeal swab procedure (training provided)
- Phlebotomy - support clinical tests and diagnosis through the venipuncture procedure (training provided)
- Admin and Ops - support ground operations (e.g. registration, assist in moving supplies) and compliance with health monitoring

### Training and commitment
Training will be provided to prepare you for this role - these include e-learning modules in infection control, and in-person training in one of two specialised skills: (i) nasopharyngeal swab procedure; (ii) phlebotomy. Training duration will be between 1-3 days, and enlistees who have completed training will standby for activation (i.e. agree to being contacted by healthcare institutions).

Training will be fully funded by the SG Healthcare Corps, and conducted by the Corps' training partners.

### Post-training deployment
Upon completion of training, you will be qualified to work as a Healthcare Operations Support Staff at ground operations. We will do a best match based on your expressed preferences, availability, and where manpower needs are. If there is a good match and you are activated for deployment, you will be remunerated for your time and contribution. Part-time and full-time opportunities are both available.
