Community care is a pivotal part of our healthcare system, and covers a range of care settings such as nursing homes, senior care centres, community hospitals, and hospices. Seniors cared for in the community will require more support especially amidst COVID-19, and you can play a part in their care.

With training, individuals with or without healthcare experience can support care of our seniors through these roles:

- **Community Care Ambassadors** - support basic care and activities within nursing homes or senior care centres in collaboration with care staff.
- **Healthcare Assistants** - work as part of a care team to deliver basic to intermediate care for seniors with care needs.

### Training and commitment
Training will be provided to prepare you for work and volunteer roles at community care organisations These include e-learning and in-person modules in:

- _Basic care_ - supporting seniors in activities of daily living, and monitoring of vital signs
- _Mobility assistance_ - techniques in lifting and transferring seniors, falls prevention
- _Communication and Engagement_ - engaging seniors in social and recreational activities

Training is fully funded by the SG Healthcare Corps, and will be conducted through our training partners. Interested individuals should be able to commit to the full training duration:

- Community Care Ambassador - 5 days (or 3 days for former nurses)
- Healthcare Assistant - 17 days, with on-the-job training thereafter

Enlistees who have completed training will standby for activation (i.e. agree to being contacted by community care organisations) for at least 3 months.

### Post-training deployment
If you have completed training, you will be qualified to work or volunteer in community care for roles you received training in. We will do a best match based on your expressed preferences, availability, and available opportunities. Part-time, full-time, and volunteer opportunities are available across various community care organisations. If there is a good match and you are activated for deployment, you will be remunerated for your time and contribution.
