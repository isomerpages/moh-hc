Community care is a pivotal part of our healthcare system, and covers a range of care settings such as nursing homes, senior care centres, community hospitals, and hospices. Seniors cared for in the community will require more support especially amidst COVID-19, and you can play a part in their care.

With training, individuals with or without healthcare experience can support care of our seniors through these roles:

- **Community Care Ambassadors** - support basic care and activities within nursing homes or senior care centres in collaboration with care staff.
- **Healthcare Assistants** - work as part of a care team to deliver basic to intermediate care for seniors with care needs.

### Training and commitment
Training will be provided to prepare you for work and volunteer roles at community care organisations These include e-learning and in-person modules in:

- _Basic care_ - supporting seniors in activities of daily living, and monitoring of vital signs
- _Mobility assistance_ - techniques in lifting and transferring seniors, falls prevention
- _Communication and Engagement_ - engaging seniors in social and recreational activities

Training is fully funded by the SG Healthcare Corps, and will be conducted through our training partners. Interested individuals should be able to commit to the full training duration:

- Community Care Ambassador - 5 days (or 3 days for former nurses)
- Healthcare Assistant - 17 days, with on-the-job training thereafter

Enlistees who have completed training will standby for activation (i.e. agree to being contacted by community care organisations) for at least 3 months.

### Post-training deployment
If you have completed training, you will be qualified to work or volunteer in community care for roles you received training in. We will do a best match based on your expressed preferences, availability, and available opportunities. Part-time, full-time, and volunteer opportunities are available across various community care organisations. If there is a good match and you are activated for deployment, you will be remunerated for your time and contribution.

## Joining as a Community Care Ambassador / Healthcare Assistant

### Who can join?
While caregiving experience is relevant, we welcome individuals with or without healthcare background to join us. Please indicate your interest via the forms on the respective links, and ensure that you can commit to the full training duration. Do note that you must be aged 18 years old and above to be considered for training and roles.

### How and where will I serve, if I am activated?
With the support of the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC), you will be matched to a community care organisation providing care for seniors in settings such as nursing homes or senior care centres. Most of these organisations offer full-time or part-time work opportunities, or volunteer roles. As part of your training, you will receive on-the-job training in some of these organisations - you may consider staying on to serve with them, or secure a match with another organisation recommended by AIC. As your training is fully funded, enlistees are expected to serve for at least 3 months with a community care organisation post-training.

### Will I require additional insurance or indemnity to support COVID-19 efforts?
Your safety is our priority. You will be working alongside care teams in the community care organisations, who will put in place precautionary measures and training to ensure workplace safety and health. On your part, please note to only serve if you are well, i.e. have no flu-like symptoms such as fever and cough, and do not have long-term health conditions that put you at increased risk of COVID-19 or other illnesses.

To the extent not covered by any existing insurance, indemnity, or compensation schemes, the Government of the Republic of Singapore will indemnify anything done or omitted to be done in good faith and with reasonable care by all medical practitioners and healthcare workers, in the discharge of their functions and duties in efforts to prevent and reduce the spread of COVID-19.

### I've signed up via one of the forms. What's next?
Thank you for your interest in joining the SG Healthcare Corps! If you have signed up, you will be invited to join our outreach channels to receive the latest updates. If there is a good match, we will be in touch with you via email or phone call to confirm your enlistment and training placement. Stay tuned, share this opportunity to #standby4SG, and keep well.
